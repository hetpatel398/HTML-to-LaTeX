  <title>COP701(Assignment 1) : HTML to LaTeX Converter</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Introduction :</h1>
  <p>In this submission I have created HTML to Latex converter in python language using <a href='https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html'>PLY</a> library for Lex and YACC implementation<small>(This report was written in html and then converted using my code to LaTeX to generate pdf.)</small></p>
  <p>In this submission I have created five major files.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>run.py</b> : Our main file which will be called from the shell file with file arguments to generate output file</li>
    <li><b>LEX_ply.py</b> : Which will give us our tokenizer(i.e. it will tokenize our input file)</li>
    <li><b>YACC_ply.py</b> : Which will contain our parser generated using CFG and this file will generate HTML's ast</li>
    <li><b>node.py</b> : This file will contain declaration of node representation which is used to create AST</li>
    <li><b>createLatex.py</b> : This file will contain necessary code to map HTML ast to equivalent LaTeX ast and generate output file using LaTeX ast</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Overview of LEX and YACC operations:</h1>

  <h2>LEX : </h2>
  <div><ul><li>Here the lex file will read input file and generate the stream of token which will be consumed by YACC.</li>
  <li>Every token generated will have a type and a value. And every types of tokens that can be generated should be written in a tuple named tokens in this file.</li>
  <li>Here in my LEX file I haven't written matching expression for every tag but instead I have written functions for opening OPENING_TAG, CLOSING_TAG and SINGLE_TAG
  which will generate token in such a way that their type will be represented by tag's name with some prefix according to the type. e.g. html tag's opening tag's token will have type as HTML_O
  ,html tag's ending tag type will be HTML_E as it is exit tag of html tag and hence E and br will have type BR_S as it is single tag</li>
  <li>If there is any unknown tag that we don't know in advance and we haven't added its type in tokens tuple then it will give its type as OPENING_TAG, CLOSING_TAG, SINGLE_TAG accordingly. And while conversion I have written that part as it is. I have done this to make sure that there are no lexical ot syntax error if we end up having any new tag.</li></ul></div>
  <h2>YACC : </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In yacc file I have written CFG required to build parser by YACC.</li>
    <li>I have written the grammer rules in the YACC file's beginnig as comment</li>
  </ul>
<h1>Abstract Syntax Tree Structure : </h1>
<ul>
  <li> To implement AST I have created a new Node class in node.py . Every node will have the following three fields
    <ol>
      <li><b>type</b>[datatype:String] : This string will hold type of the node</li>
        <li><b>attributes</b>[datatype:dictionary] : This field will hold the attributes reuired for the node in a dictionary. This can be used for several purposes such as I have stores value attribute in STRING type of node and while writing that to file I will get the string from the attributes' dictionary.</li>
        <li><b>children</b>[datatype:list] : This field will hold the children of the current node. We are using this list as we can have multiple children.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
  <h1>HTML Abstract Syntax Tree generation :</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Here in YACC_ply.py file I have written function for every production in my grammer and p[0] will represent what our left side of the production will return from where it was expanded. Here in every production except the starting procduction I am returning a list of nodes.</li>
    <li>So in parent production when a terminal's production gets called it will return a list of nodes which I will add to that node's children using function defined in Node class.</li>
    <li>Suppose I have a production like <b>body_data : body_data P_O body_data P_E data</b> so here I will return <b>p[0]=sum([p[1],[Node('P',{},p[3])],p[5]],[])</b> as p[1] and p[3] are list of nodes and node(s) return by p[1] and p[5] will be the children of our p node whose children will be p[3]. And here sum function will take these three lists of nodes and will give us a single list of nodes which will be assigned to its parent</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>HTML AST to LaTeX AST Mapping</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>In file createLatex.py I have written a function called mapHTMLastToLATEXast(root) which will take a root node as a parameter and will map HTML AST to LaTeX AST</li>
    <li>In that function I have created a mapping for every node type of HTML AST to LaTeX AST.</li>
    <li>Now I will convert the type of root node accordingly and then make recursive calls to its children as new roots and so on.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>LaTeX output file generation</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>I have written a function called createLatexFileFromLatexAst(node,file) in createLatex.py file. To generate output file we will call this function with root node of LaTeX AST and output file as a parameter to this function and we will get the specified output file.</li>
    <li>In that function I have written some other inner function which are reposnsible for conversion of every node type of LaTeX AST.</li>
    <li>First of all I will get the corrosponding function for a given node type using a dictionary in which we will have node types as keys & its corrosponding function as its value.</li>
    <li>After that we will call that function and In that function I have written some mapping in LaTeX file and then I will recursively call this function on every chidren of this node. After that children list is finished I will write some post operations That are required in LaTeX such as \end{center}, closing a curly brace, etc. </li>
  </ul>
