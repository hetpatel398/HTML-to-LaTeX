# HTML to LaTeX Converter

In this project I have created a converter which will take simple html file as an input and will generate euivalent latex file as output using python and PLY library.

To run this project you just need to run run.sh file which is  included or you can run python script run.py, both with two arguments first one is input file name and second one output file name.
